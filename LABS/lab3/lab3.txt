The purpose of this lab is to practice working with Python's higher order 
and ternary operator. Write all of your code in one script named lab3.py.

Let a be the list of values produced by list(range(1, 11)).

[1 point] Using the map function and a lambda argument, write an expression that
produces a list of the cubes of the values in a. Assign the result to a variable
called m and print m.

[1 point] Using the filter function and a lambda argument, write an expression 
that produces a list of the values in a that are divisible by 3. Assign the 
result to a variable called f1 and print f1.

[1 point] Using the reduce function and a lambda argument, write an expression 
that returns the result of concatenating all the digits in a. Assign the result 
to a variable called r1 and print r1. The output from this step is the string 
'12345678910'

[1 point] Use a list comprehension to produce the same list as in question 1 
(i.e., the new list will contain the cubes of the values in a).

[1 point] Use a list comprehension to produce the same list as in question 2.

[1 point] Use a list comprehension to produce a list containing the cubes of 
the values in a that are divisible by 3. The output from this step is the list 
[27, 216, 729]

[2 points] Write a function named evenFilter that takes as an argument a 
dictionary of elements indexed by integer keys. Using only a list comprehension,
return the values of the elements associated with the keys that are evenly 
divisible by 2. For example,

>>> data = {1: "one", 3: "three", 4: "four", 5: "five", 8: "eight", 10: "ten"}
>>> print(evenFilter(data))
['four', 'eight', 'ten']

[2 points] Write a function called findMin(x, y) that uses the ternary operator
to find and return the minimum of its two arguments. Write code to test this 
function.



Name your file lab3.py. Make sure to include your name and the name of your 
TRACE folder at the top of the file in a docstring. When you are done, 
demonstrate your code to the instructor and upload your solution in your CSC131 
upload folder in a folder called LABS\lab3.
