CSC 131 - Introduction to Computer Science 1
Lab 4 Due 2/5/15

Write the code for a class named Point to represent a point in the Cartesian plane with x and y coordinates. The class contains:

Two instance variables x and y that represent the coordinates with getX() and getY() methods.
A constructor that constructs a point with specified coordinates, with default values 0 and 0.
An __str__ method to return a string representation in the form (x, y).
A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to another point.
Appropriate code so that points can be compared using the comparison operators. Points are compared based on their distance from the origin.
Add a test program that does the following:

Creates a point object, named p1, with coordinates at (3,4)
Print p1
Creates another point object, named p2, with coordinates at (3,0)
Print the x and y coordinates of p2 using the getX() and getY() methods
Find and print the distance between p1 and p2
Print the results of comparing p1 and p2. Make sure to test all 6 comparison operators.
Your code should allow using == and != to compare a Point object with an object of a different type. Print the result of using the equality and inequality operators to compare p1 with the string "Hello".
Name your file lab4.py. Make sure to include your name and the name of your TRACE folder at the top of the file in a docstring. When you are done, demonstrate your code to the instructor and upload your solution in your CSC131 upload folder in a folder called LABS\lab4.
